I"Ö<p>Finally after much ado, I am moving Gotchacode to Octopress. There are various reasons for doing it.
I am listing some of them here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There is absolutely no good theme if you are running a technical blog.</li>
  <li>Syntax highlighting is pathetic.</li>
  <li>I canâ€™t write post in my text editor.</li>
  <li>There is no source control.</li>
</ul>

<p>But I will miss blogspot too. The integrated analytics was best in class and so was the SEO.</p>
